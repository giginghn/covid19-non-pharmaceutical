# COVID-19: What do we know about Non-pharmaceutical interventions?

## Background
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

## The Challenge
Kaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. 

While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 2 and May 14 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.

As the data becomes available, Kaggle will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).

## Analysis
In this challenge, I will be analyzing the open-source data from different contributors on Kaggle to answer these critical questions:

- **What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?** Ex: quarantine, cancelling large gatherings, widespread testing, etc.)

- **What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?** Ex: Data on temperature, humidity and wind speed by region.

- **What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?** Ex: Percentage of the population that smokes, numbers of death by lung diseses or numbers of ICU for the patients in a country.

In addition, I will predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases as well as fatal cases in **184 countries** across the world for future dates **(ranging from April 2 - May 14)**.

**Disclaimer from Kaggle:** We understand this is a serious situation, and in no way want to trivialize the human impact this crisis is causing by predicting fatalities. Our goal is to provide better methods for estimates that can assist medical and governmental institutions to prepare and adjust as pandemics unfold.
